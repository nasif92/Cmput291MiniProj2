Name of constributors with constribution:

1) Nasif Hossain: I helped a bit on the implementation of phase 1. And put the code together and more presentable for phase-1. Finished phase 1 error checks and mainly email.txt.

For phase 2:
We need to use perl the break.pl using perl break.pl < dates.txt
  1) sorted dates.txt using sort -u dates.txt -o dates.txt.
  Then got the index as: db_load -T -c duplicates=1 -f dates.txt -t btree da.idx
  2) sorted recs.txt using sort -nu recs.txt -o recs.txt.
  then got the index as : db_load -T -c duplicates=1 -f recs.txt -t hash re.idx
  3) sorted emails.txt using sort -u email10.txt -o sortedemails.txt
  then got the index as : db_load -T -c duplicates=1 -f emails.txt -t btree em.idx
  4) sorted terms.txt as sort -u terms.txt -o terms.txt.
  then got the index as: 
2) Yazan: Worked with Nasif on recs.py, dates.py, emails.py, and planning on taking a closer look on phase 2.

3) Yan: Trying to solve terms.txt and b+ tree in phase 2

Sprint planning for November 18, 2019:

Time chart:

Monday: Fix phase 1 recs.txt and start phase 2.
Tuesday: Phase 1 and phase 2 completion. Optional: start phase 3
Wednesday: At least have 1/2 queries done for phase 3. Reading the stuff from Berkeley Db.
Thursday: Last meeting before weekend. WE must start phase 3 in our machines.
Friday: AT LEAST HAVE 80 percent (best 100%) of phase 3 done.
on the weekends: Testing and debugging
Sunday: make it modular and presentable. Submit my night.
